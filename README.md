My starting point was to become a good coder then I decided to turn it into becoming an excellent Frontend-developer. Firstly it was just curiosity then I turned it into a hobby and I am coming to implement my dream. I started to looking for online courses and then I found out about EPAM company which allows people around the globe learn and realize their aim. Right now I enrolled the course and I am excited to learn skills  from great mentors and meet new people. 
I have some skils in HTML, CSS, and basic Java-Script. I tried to create several web pages and I enjoed it. However, HTML and CSS are not programe language whereas Java Script is. But to understand and gain skills it is difficult to learn on your own. I needed mentors which can share and teach their skills and hekp me to obtain this skills.

Curently, I also study at English course and try to take IELTS exam which I hope helps me to apply and consider work around the world.
